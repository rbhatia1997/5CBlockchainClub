# Introduction to EOS.IO & Development With It

## Introduction 

If you're reading this with no prior experience to Blockchain, I would suggest reading over the Blockchain.md tutorial. I'm going to assume base knowledge in this tutorial (which seems counter-intuitive, but it's base knowledge in blockchain understanding not how to use EOS). EOSIO based blockchains code using WebAssembly (WASM), which is a web standard gaining support. So, EOSIO actually uses C++. Also, you're going to want to know how to use the command line, which I've provided information in the README.md.
