This is a public repository for the 5C Cryptocurrency Blockchain. We will post relevant research and related information here! The first step is to create a GitHub account! First, find a profile pictureand save it to your computer's desktop. Then, you can create a GitHub account [here](https://github.com/). You can change your profile photo through the following link [here](https://github.com/settings/profile). Make sure that when you click this link, you hit **Upload New Picture**.

Now, assuming that you have set up a GitHub account, you're going to want to set up an editor. Normally, people use something called vim. You can also use a different editor by using the following command in your terminal or command prompt window `git config --global core.editor <editor-command>`.
