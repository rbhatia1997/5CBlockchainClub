# Getting Started with Solidity

Before starting this tutorial, I want to give a bit of context to Solidity and why it might be important for one to understand. 

So first, what is Ethereum. Ethereum is "a global, open-source platform for decentralized applications" according to their [website](https://www.ethereum.org/). Actually this website would be the best place to start to understand what exactly is going on with Ethereum.

Let's get excited about Ethereum. It's time for a new era of the Internet - one in which money and payments are built-in and you own your data. No company or person should own the infrastructure - it should be a neutral, open-access infrastructure. Founded in 2015, Ethereum is the world's "leading programmable blockchain" and has a native cryptocurrency called Ether (ETH). 

The cool part about learning Ethereum is that you can build decentralized applications (called dapps) that utilize the very technology of cryptocurrency/blockchain. Games, decentralized markets, cryptocurrency wallets, and other financial applications are all possible.

"Ethereum is different than Bitcoin in that it allows for smart contracts which can be described as highly programmable digital money. Imagine automatically sending money from one person to another but only when a certain set of conditions are met." [Source](https://blog.coinbase.com/a-beginners-guide-to-ethereum-46dd486ceecf)

Some applications which exist include Cent (social network where you earn money by posting), Veil (placing bets on real world events), and CryptoKitties (collecting and breeding digital cats). Before I continue, I should plug the resources available on Ethereum's website, which will likely be more helpful than my rambling.

## Introduction to Solidity 

Now that there is some context into Ethereum, it is important to introduce Solidity. Ethereum uses something called smart contracts (programs on the Ethereum blockchain) that send or receive Ether (amongst many other things). 

So this is cool and all, but Ethereum contracts are actually written in a programming language. One very common language is Solidity (which is the language of choice).

Solidity's code uses something called *contracts* which are the fundamental building block of ethereum applications. All the variables and functions belong to this *contract* and it is the starting point of a project. 

So when starting a ```.sol``` project file in Solidity, you're going to want to first enter the Solidity version that you're working with (which can be done by typing in the following:

```javascript
pragma solidity ^0.4.25; // Indicates version

contract HelloWorld {
    // Put your work here. 
}
```

State variables are stored in contract storage (written to the blockchain) - so it's similar to writing them to a database. I've noticed that writing in Solidity is similar to C++ where you have to add a semicolon at the end of every line of code. Obviously, as with any programming language, the basic math operations are built in. 

## Getting Deeper into Solidity...

So now, we may need more complex data types. Solidity provides something called *structs* which come in the following form: 

```javascript

struct Thing {
  uint variable1;
  string variable2;
}
```

Now, if we want a collection of something, we want to use data types called *arrays*, which are either dynamic or fixed. A dynamic array has no fixed size; a fixed array has a fixed size. You would do the following:

```javascript

uint[2] fixedArray; 
string[5] stringArray; 
uint[] dynamicArray; 
```

You can even create an array of structs if you wanted to by doing the following: ```Thing[] thing1;``` assuming we had a Thing struct. 

Arrays can be public, which allows Solidity to enable access to it if other people are using your code. You just need to add the word "public" in front of the array type like so: ```Thing[] public thingArray;```. Other contracts could read from but not write to this array. 

Therefore, if we wanted to create new Things and add them to the thing array, we would simply do the following: 

```javascript
// create a New Thing:
Thing thing22 = Thing(22, "Thing22");

// Add that person to the Array:
thingArray.push(thing22);
```

Cleaner code would probably do the following: 

```javascript
thingArray.push(Thing(22, "Thing22"));
// adds to end of the thingArray.
```

If you want to write a function in Solidity, you just use the word ```function``` and specify the parameters in the call. Many people often start function parameter names with an underscore to differentiate these from global variables. This would look like the following: 

```javascript
function createThing (string _nameOfThing, uint _numberOfThing) {
    // do stuff here. 
}
```

Combining this information with what was learnt above, we notice that we could push items to the public array using this function if we simply add the following line: 

```javascript
function createThing (string _nameOfThing, uint _numberOfThing) {
    thingArray.push(Thing(_nameofThing,_numberOfThing)); 
}
```

In Solidity, functions are public by default; however, this means that anyone can just call the contract's function and execute the code. Obviously, this may not be great for your application so thankfully we can make functions private (which we want to probably set by default unless we for sure want to give people the ability to publically access something).Â 

You'd just accomplish this by adding the word ```private``` after the function's parameters. For some reason, we call the function with an underscore to indicate that it's a private function. So using the example above, we'd have:

```javascript
function _createThing (string _nameOfThing, uint _numberOfThing) private {
    thingArray.push(Thing(_nameofThing,_numberOfThing)); 
}
```
## Getting Even Deeper into Solidity...

As you may know already, functions can return values by using the keyword ```return```. In Solidity, we also have to consider function modifiers that indicate
